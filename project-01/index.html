      <h1>Welcome to the PT's world, where Healing Meets Movement!</h1>
      <p>Hey there! I’m Fatima Thawerani, a passionate Physical Therapy student stepping into the amazing world of healing, movement, and recovery. This space is where I share my journey from classroom lessons to real-life experiences as I learn what it truly means to help people move better and live stronger.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h1>About My Journey</h1>
        <p>
          Physical therapy isn’t just a career path for me, it’s a calling. Every muscle, joint, and movement tells a story, and I’m here to understand it all. 
          Through my studies, internships, and hands-on practice, I’m discovering how science and compassion work together to change lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you’ll find reflections, study tips, therapy insights, and stories that inspire both future PTs and anyone curious about how the body heals through movement.

        <h2>Why I Started This Page?</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to create a space that celebrates what being a PT student is all about — the challenges, the victories, the endless learning, 
          and the joy of helping others move freely again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re a fellow PT student, a future therapist, or just someone who loves learning about the human body —
          welcome to the PT’s World.
